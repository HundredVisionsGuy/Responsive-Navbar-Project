        <h2>Dr. Who</h2>
        <p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</p>
        <p>"Foul play!" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence. "What foul play! What does the man mean?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</li>
            <li>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</li>
            <li>Saving the world with meals on wheels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No... It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? They're not aliens, they're Earth...liens!</p>
        <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! <strong> The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.</strong> <em>...hey.</em> ...the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
        <h2 id="jekyll">Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde</h2>

            <li>"Come," said the lawyer, "I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is."</li>
            <li>"I think there's been foul play," said Poole, hoarsely.</li>
            <li>"Foul play!" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence. "What foul play! What does the man mean?"</li>
